# ABBA: An Agent-Based Model of the Banking System

> A thorough analysis of risks in the banking system requires incorporating banks’ inherent
heterogeneity and adaptive behavior in response to shocks and changes in business
conditions and the regulatory environment. ABBA is an agent-based model for analyzing
risks in the banking system in which banks’ business decisions drive the endogenous
formation of interbank networks. ABBA allows for a rich menu of banks’ decisions,
contingent on banks’ balance sheet and capital position, including dividend payment rules,
credit expansion, and dynamic balance sheet adjustment via risk-weight optimization. The
platform serves to illustrate the effect of changes on regulatory requirements on solvency,
liquidity, and interconnectedness risk. It could also constitute a basic building block for
further development of large, bottom-up agent-based macro-financial models.
